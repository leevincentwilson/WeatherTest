## Senior Frontend Engineer - Tech Test

### Instructions

Your goal in this task is to implement a simple front-end for a weather application.  Implement a simple SPA to consume the [OpenWeatherMap api](http://openweathermap.org/) and display the current date/time and weather in the city of London.  

As technical requirements, please use React and the Open Weather API, but all other decisions are yours to make.  The result should be documented well enough that a technically literate person (but not necessarily a front-end developer) should be able to install and run your example on localhost. Display and style the result any way you like;  this is a prototype and does not need to be complete or pretty, but simple things (e.g. vertical and horizontal centering) make for a more pleasant experience.

Remember that this is a simple prototype and not a finished product.  Polish is not required; do not spend time on tests or edge cases.  

### Submitting

Please submit your solution as a Github repo or a zipped directory with a git repo inside;  commit early and often rather than in one single push so that we can see a history.  Trial and error is allowed and encouraged!

Also, please do not spend more than a couple of hours on the task;  the goal is produce a simple prototype and provide material for discussion in an interview, not to soak up your free time.  

### Points for discussion in an interview

Consider the following questions:

* How would you test this application?
* How would you extend the app to allow a user to search for their favourite city?
* Imagine the component hierarchy required to implement a "compare cities" feature.
